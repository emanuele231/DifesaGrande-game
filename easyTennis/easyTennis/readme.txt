*** easyTennis players ***

These are a color-changed version of up&down players I made for easyTennis - a small 2d pixelart tennis-like game I made in April 2018 with Defold

GooglePlay: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marcogiorgini.defold.easytennis

I think, despite their defects, they're nice, and they fit well in this kind of game (at least for prototyping).

Sprite are 60x64 pixels. They are provided as a single image with all the frames, and as single frames png
These are the animation details:

Idle: frame 1-2
Slow movement: frame 3-4
Fast movement: frame 5-6-7-8-7-6
Hit 1: frame 9-10-11
Hit 2: frame 12-13-14
Hit 3: frame 15-16-17

Ah, I added to the package also the tennis field and the ball (three size, to use during motion, plus the shadow)

I release them with CC BY 3.0 licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) that means you can use them freely, even for commercial purposes, and you can adapt them if you need it.

Only requested things is to credit me:

I hope they can help you in some of your projects. If so, and if you want, drop me a line telling me about your game.
